## About MIUI

### What is MIUI?

MIUI is Xiaomi's own custom Android interface which runs on most of their devices by default. It's getting updated on a weekly basis and its development is very community-oriented. All news, suggestions and feedback are posted and collected on the MIUI forums and testing is done by the community as well. As a result, there are updates every week, consisting of bug fixes and new features. MIUI receives a major update once a year, in a similar fashion to Android itself. The design of the UI differs from Google's Material Design and resembles iOS to some degree.
