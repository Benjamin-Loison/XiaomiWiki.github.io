## Fix notifications on MIUI

MIUI likes to kill apps that run in the background to save battery life but many users don't like this strategy because this way they miss important notifications. Thankfully it's possible to disable most of these countermeasures.

### Instructions

* Go to Settings > Battery > Battery saver > Choose apps and tap on the three dots in the top-right corner then select Turn off battery saver.

* Go to Settings > Battery > Smart scenes > Scenes and turn off the strategies here.
  
* Go to Settings > Permissions > Autostart and enable autostart for the apps you want to receive notifications from.  
  
* Go to Settings > Notifications & status bar > App notifications and tweak the notification settings for the apps the way you want.
